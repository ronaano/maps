## Maps API mini-project

This is a simple app I did while learning TypeScript.
Using the Google Maps API, a map is created in the application.
This application then randomly generates a marker for a User and Company on the map.
For a User and Company markers, it displays the User's name and Company name and catchphrase respectively.
I used the faker npm package, for the randomly generated data for Company and User.

## Learning

I learnt about the TypeScript syntax, Type Annotations, Type inference engine, interfaces, Type Definition Files, TypeScript Design Patterns.
