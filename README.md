## Maps API mini-project

This is a simple app I did while learning TypeScript.
Using the Google Maps API, it randomly generates a marker for a User and Company.
For a User marker, it displays the name and for a Company it display the Company name as well as their Catchphrase

## Learning

I learnt about the TypeScript syntax, annotations, TS inference engine, interfaces, TypeScript Design Patterns.
